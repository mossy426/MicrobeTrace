## Introduction

This Testing Plan outlines a comprehensive approach to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the **MicrobeTrace** client-side application. Given the application's complexity, which includes dynamic visualizations, user interactions, and extensive data handling, a multi-faceted testing strategy is essential to deliver a robust and user-friendly experience.

## Objectives

- **Ensure Functional Accuracy:** Validate that all features operate as intended.
- **Maintain Visual Integrity:** Ensure visualizations render correctly across various scenarios and configurations.
- **Enhance User Experience:** Confirm that user interactions are smooth, intuitive, and free of defects.
- **Facilitate Continuous Improvement:** Integrate testing seamlessly into the development lifecycle for ongoing quality assurance.

## Scope

The testing plan covers the following aspects of MicrobeTrace:

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components and services.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensuring different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulating real user interactions to validate complete workflows.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Ensuring the visual aspects of the application remain consistent over time.

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing with Jasmine/Karma

**Purpose:** Validate the functionality of individual components, services, and utilities in isolation.

**Approach:**

- **Component Testing:**
  - Test Angular components (e.g., `TwoDComponent`, `FilesComponent`) to ensure they render correctly based on inputs.
  - Verify component lifecycle hooks (`OnInit`, `OnDestroy`) function as expected.
  
- **Service Testing:**
  - Test services like `CommonService` to ensure methods handle data processing accurately.
  - Mock dependencies to isolate service functionality.

- **Utility Functions:**
  - Test utility functions (e.g., `convertName`, `delayFunction`) for correct outputs given various inputs.

**Examples:**
- Verify that `FilesComponent` correctly processes different file types (JSON, CSV, XLSX).
- Ensure `CommonService` accurately updates session states when thresholds change.

### 2. Integration Testing with Jasmine/Karma

**Purpose:** Ensure that different modules and components interact correctly.

**Approach:**

- **Component-Module Interaction:**
  - Test interactions between `FilesComponent` and `CommonService`.
  
- **Service Dependencies:**
  - Validate that `CommonService` correctly collaborates with other services and components, such as updating visualization states based on user inputs.

- **Data Flow:**
  - Ensure data flows seamlessly between components, services, and utilities without loss or corruption.

**Examples:**
- Test that uploading a file through `FilesComponent` correctly invokes `CommonService` methods and updates the visualization.
- Verify that changing a distance threshold in the settings appropriately updates the network visualization.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Selenium

**Purpose:** Simulate real user interactions to validate complete workflows and ensure the application behaves as expected from the user's perspective.

**Approach:**

- **User Workflow Simulation:**
  - Automate user actions such as uploading files, adjusting settings, and interacting with visualizations.
  
- **Visual Verification:**
  - Although Selenium doesn’t inherently support visual comparisons, integrate it with visual regression tools to ensure visual elements render correctly after interactions.

**Examples:**
- Automate the process of loading different file types and verify that the corresponding visualizations update accordingly.
- Simulate user interactions like setting distance thresholds and ensure the network visualization reflects these changes accurately.

### 4. Visual Regression Testing

**Purpose:** Ensure the visual aspects of the application remain consistent over time and that UI changes do not introduce unintended visual defects.

**Approach:**

- **Baseline Image Capture:**
  - Capture screenshots of various application states representing different user interactions and configurations.

- **Comparison and Detection:**
  - Compare current screenshots against baseline images to detect visual discrepancies.

- **Integration with E2E Tests:**
  - Trigger visual regression tests as part of the E2E testing workflow to automate visual verification.

**Tools:**
- **BackstopJS:** An open-source tool for visual regression testing.
- **Applitools Eyes:** An AI-powered visual testing tool offering advanced features.
- **Resemble.js:** A JavaScript library for image comparison.

**Examples:**
- After setting a specific distance threshold, capture the updated network visualization and compare it against the expected baseline.
- Verify that loading a new dataset results in the correct visual representation without unintended UI changes.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Unit and Integration Testing:**
  - **Jasmine:** A behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
  - **Karma:** A test runner that allows executing tests in real browsers.
  
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - **Selenium WebDriver:** Automates browser interactions for testing.
  - **WebDriverIO:** A modern testing framework built on top of Selenium WebDriver.
  
- **Visual Regression Testing:**
  - **BackstopJS:** For capturing and comparing screenshots.
  - **Applitools Eyes:** For AI-powered visual testing and smart comparisons.
  - **Resemble.js:** For custom image comparisons within test scripts.
  
- **Build and CI/CD Integration:**
  - **Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI:** For orchestrating automated test executions.
  
## Test Coverage Goals
